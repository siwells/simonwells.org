My latest paper, titled "[On The Role of Dialogue Models in the Age of Large Language Models](/publications#wells_2023_cmna)", will be presented at the upcoming 23rd Annual International Workshop on [Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'23)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna23/).

The paper is joint work with [Mark Snaith](https://marksnaith.com/) from [RGU](https://www.rgu.ac.uk/) in which we consider the roles that dialogue models play in computational dialogue, how that role is changing with the advent of large-language models (LLMs) that are increasingly capable of dialogue, and argue that even with LLMs that are maximally capable of engaging in dialogue , there'll still be a role for dialogue model research as in order to provide external bench-marks and regulatory guidance, for LLMs, just as they do for humans.
