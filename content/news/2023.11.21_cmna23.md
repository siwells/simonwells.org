The [23rd annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'23)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna23/) will run on Friday 1st December. This year we are running online, unaffiliated with a wider host conference.

This year we have a really nice lineup of papers covering many interesting topics from within the CMNA remit. The [programme](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna23/programme/) is available and all contributed papers will be archived in CEUR Workshop proceedings [volume #????]().
