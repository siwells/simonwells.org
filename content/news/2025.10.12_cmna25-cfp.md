The [25th annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'25)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/) will run on 12th December this year. CMNA'25 will run as a free, open, online workshop in this, our twenty-fifth year.

This year we are soliciting contributions on the special theme of "Reflections & Horizons: The past 25 years of Computational Models of Natural Argument and visions of things to come". We intend to interpret this theme broadly, to reflect the wide range of argumentative practices and models that have been studied and shared at CMNA. We also encourage reflection on the development of argumentation theory within the remit of CMNA during the last 25 years. Finally we also encourage forward looking contributions that share a vision of how argumentation research might develop over the next quarter century.

Looking forward to another event filled with interesting research, papers, positions, people, and discussions.
