The [William Grant Foundation](https://www.williamgrantfoundation.org.uk/) has funded our "[West of Scotland Herring Hunt (WoSHH)](https://www.napier.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-search/projects/west-of-scotland-herring-hunt-woshh)" project to the tune of Â£154,550.45. I am a co-investigator on this project which will investigate both historical and contemporary Herring spawning on the West coast of Scotland with the goal of informing policy decisions leading to their future sustainability.

Lots of work to do in the upcoming months and years, to meet a fairly ambitious agenda...
