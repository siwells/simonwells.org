Today I presented my latest paper, joint work with Mark Snaith, on the Simple Argument Description Notation (SADN)  to the CMNA community at the [25th annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'25)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/).

This talk, and it's associated paper, introduce the Simple Argument Description Notation (SADN), a set of commands for the SADFace REPL to enable declarative text-user-interface (TUI) driven construction and manipulation of argument structures.
