I presented my latest research on "[Dialogue Cartography](/publications#wells_2025_eca)"(extended abstract), at the [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://ecargument.org/). The [slides](/talks#wisconsin_2025) from the presentation are available to download. The paper that this work describes is to appear in the upcoming psot-proceedings of the Fifth European Conference on Argumentation.
