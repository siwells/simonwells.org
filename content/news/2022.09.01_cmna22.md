The [22nd annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'22)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna22/) will run on 12th September in Cardiff. This year, in line with the peripatetic tradition of CMNA, we will be hosted by the [9th International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA 2022)](https://comma22.cs.cf.ac.uk/workshops.html).

This year we have a really nice lineup of papers covering many interesting topics from within the CMNA remit. The [programme](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna22/programme/) is available and all contributed papers are archived in CEUR Workshop proceedings [volume #3205](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3205/).
