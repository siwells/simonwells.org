I presented my latest research on "[Dialogue Cartography](/publications#wells_2025_eca)"(extended abstract), at the [Fifth European Conference on Argumentation](https://ecargument.org/). The [slides](/talks#eca_25_a) from the presentation are available with final paper to follow as the post-proceedings publications comes together in November.
