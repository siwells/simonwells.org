My latest paper, joint work with Mark Snaith, on the Simple Argument Description Notation (SADN) has been accepted to the [25th annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'25)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/).

This paper introduces SADN, a set of commands for the SADFace REPL to enable declarative text-user-interface (TUI) driven construction and manipulation of argument structures.
