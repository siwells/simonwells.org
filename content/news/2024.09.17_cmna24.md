The [24th annual international workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA'24)](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna22/) will run on 17th September in Hagen, Germany. This year, in line with the peripatetic tradition of CMNA, we will be hosted by the [10th International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA 2024)](https://comma2024.krportal.org/workshops.html).

This year we have a really nice lineup of papers covering many interesting topics from within the CMNA remit. The [programme](https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna24/programme/) is available and all contributed papers are archived in CEUR Workshop proceedings [volume #3769](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3769/).
