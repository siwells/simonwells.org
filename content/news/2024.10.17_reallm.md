My latest paper, titled "[On The Role of Dialogue Models in the Age of Large Language Models](/publications#snaith_2024_reallm)", will be presented at the upcoming SICSA Workshop on Reasoning, Explanations and Applications of Large Language Models ([REALLM](https://reallm.rguairgroup.com/home)).

The paper is joint work with [Mark Snaith](https://marksnaith.com/) from [RGU](https://www.rgu.ac.uk/) in which we further consider the roles that dialogue models play in computational dialogue, how that role is changing with the advent of large-language models (LLMs) that are increasingly capable of dialogue, and argue that even with LLMs that are maximally capable of engaging in dialogue , there'll still be a role for dialogue model research as in order to provide external bench-marks and regulatory guidance, for LLMs, just as they do for humans. The main advance since our last paper in this area is our ongoing development of a new software framework, PreFACE, that bridges between LLMs and formal dialogue models with the aim of making the best use of the strengths of each approach.
