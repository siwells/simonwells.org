<blockquote><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this presentation I discuss the Zonal ARgumentative DialOgue visualiZation (ZARDOZ) method, an integrated and comprehensive dialogue diagramming methodology, for use in analysing, understanding, mapping, and exploring, argumentative dialogues. We illustrate and explore the method by making use of, and mapping, two exemplar dialogues due to Walton, the tipping dialogue and the Santa Claus dialogue, and a third dialogue stemming from an online interaction about the 1969 Moon landings. This way I demonstrate diagramming of the classical dialogues from the argumentation theoretic literature alongside contemporary, multi-party, online interactions.</blockquote><br />

<li><a id="eca_2025_b" style="visibility: hidden"></a>&ldquo;Retrieval Augmented Generation for Immersive Formal Dialogue&rdquo;, presented at the <a href="https://ecargument.org/">Fifth European Conference on Argumentation</a>, hosted by <a href="https://eng.pw.edu.pl/">Warsaw University of Technology</a>, <a href="https://eng.ans.pw.edu.pl/">Faculty of Administration and Social Sciences</a>, Warsaw, Poland, on Friday 26th September 2025.<br />
<blockquote><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin tools like ChatGPT but often lack structure, coherence, and grounding. Formal dialogue games offer a structured framework for goal-driven conversation, but their use in real-world applications has typically led to rigid, unnatural exchanges. This paper proposes a hybrid approach: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that uses LLMs to produce natural responses aligned with formal dialogue structure and constrained by domain-specific knowledge. Supporting both structured (e.g. argument graphs) and unstructured (e.g. document-based) sources, the pipeline generates fluent, context-relevant utterances while preserving dialogue structure and ensuring responses remain grounded in the intended knowledge domain.</blockquote><br />

<blockquote><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the roles that dialogue models play in computational dialogue, how that role is changing with the advent of large-language models (LLMs) that are increasingly capable of dialogue, and argue that even with LLMs that are maximally capable of engaging in dialogue , there’ll still be a role for dialogue model research as in order to provide external bench-marks and regulatory guidance, for LLMs, just as they do for humans.</blockquote><br /> <div style="text-align: right">[ <a href="/assets/talks/2023.12.01_cmna.pdf">pdf (slides)</a> ]</div><br /></li>

<li><a id="eca2017" style="visibility: hidden"></a>&ldquo;MIND THE GAPS: Deception in real world argumentative dialogue systems&rdquo;, presented at the  9th Conference of the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA), University of Amsterdam, NL, on Friday 6th July 2018.<br />

<blockquote><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the increasing prevalence of artificially intelligent machines in everyday life, a trend that threatens not only to continue but to accelerate, the need to examine how people interact with these machines intensifies. Whilst the basis for much of the increased interest and utility of AI has been rooted in machine learning and neural network based systems, there are also areas of particular concern for argumentation theorists. For example, regardless of how an AI decision is made internally, should that decision be called into question, then the system should be able to explain itself, and perhaps even defend itself, furthermore, the system should be able to work with people to improve decisions, should they be found wanting.

This is in line with recent trends stemming from various regulatory and professional bodies, which have independently proposed that artificial intelligence systems be capable of explaining their decisions. This trend is found both at the supranational regulatory level, in recommendations from the European Commission, as well as at the industrial professional level, in British standards for intelligent and autonomous robots.

It would appear that many years of research into formal argumentative dialogue systems may soon result in real-world payoffs. However, thorny questions remain in relation to how our ideal, normative systems of argument and dialogue will fair when exposed to real-world motivations.

Whilst it is often assumed that the truth should, or will, always be told, this can be easier said than done, and even when achievable, can be counterproductive. In this paper we attempt to shed light on some gray areas concerning truth telling, or lack thereof, in relation to human dialogical interaction with AI systems. From this investigation, we make recommendations for the design of future, real world, applied dialectical argumentation systems.</blockquote><br />

Many such problems stem from the cumulative effects of the individual behaviours of large numbers of people. Digital behaviour change mechanisms are used to support people in forming new habitual behaviours and build on rich psychological models of behaviour dynamics. Argumentation theory has rich models of both argumentation and interaction as well as extensive collections of stereotypical patterns of real-world argumentation. In this work we begin to align elements of pyschological models of behaviour change with models of argumentative interaction. The aim is to increase the motivation of bahaviour change targets, enabling them to make informed and justifiable decisions about their behaviours and to increase the overall effectiveness of behaviour change mechanisms.</blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: right">[ <a href="/assets/talks/2013.07.18_scottish.argumentation.day.pdf">pdf</a> ]</div><br /></li>
