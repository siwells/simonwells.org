* REMAR - This is a marine sustainability project that is focussed on sustainable fishing and conservation of Brazilian Mangrove Crabs. My colleague in the School of Applied Sciences, [Karen Diele](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/karen-diele), is PI but the School of Computing, with myself taking the lead, has provided technical support and implementation for the data gathering, analysis, and presentation. Our data is currently displayed in our [data dashboard](http://crabdata.napier.ac.uk/public/) and there is a deployed [Android app](https://github.com/REMAR-Project/android-app-v2.0.4), localised to Portuguese that is used to gather data on the ground in Brazil. All source code for our tools is open and available under the GPL3 license.

* μ-Argumentation – Formerly called "Argument Blogging" & subsequently "Argument micro-blogging". The aim is to harvest resources from the web and to record, reuse, and interact with them in terms of their argumentative and dialectical structure. Kind of like trackbacks but with more argumentative structure.

* Monkeypuzzle – After the lead developer retired and with the software being effectively abandoned, Monkeypuzzle is a fork of the Araucaria argument-diagramming software.

* MAgtALO – MAgtALO is a multiagent server architecture & web 2.0 front-end for effective human participation in complex real world problem domains. The aim was to do elicitation of structured real world knowledge without resorting to performing complex natural language parsing. This knowledge was then reused in agent knowledge bases to enable users positions and opinions to be represented in the system by agents in order to build a self-sustaining system that grows the more it is used.

<div style="text-align: right">[STATUS: INVOLVEMENT COMPLETE 03.2012]</div>



* Ph.D Thesis – Formal Dialectical Games In MultiAgent Argumentation – In which I surveyed a wide variety of dialogue games and laid the foundations for the A4A.

* The Information Exchange (iXchange) Project – A multi-site project to develop multiagent software that incorporates social reasoning, argumentative dialogue, and planning, applied in an eScience scenario.
